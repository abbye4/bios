        I enjoy several different hobbies. I know it is said that a perosn
        should have two hobbies. One should be to relax and the other to make
        extra income. I cannot admit that any of my hobbies have made me any
        money! I enjoy to read books and along with that buy books. I love to go
        to antique shops or thrift stores in search of possible treasures.
        Hiking is an activity I also enjoy whenever possible. I don't know if
        drinking coffee can count as a hobby, but I also love to learn and
        experiment with different types of coffee.
